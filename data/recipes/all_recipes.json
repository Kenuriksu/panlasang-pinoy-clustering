In many of these classic Filipino dishes, garlic, vinegar, and ginger team up to tantalize the tongue! We can't get enough of homestyle comfort foods like chicken adobo, pancit, afritada, and more. Give these top-rated chicken recipes a try!",
      "Step 2: Let's start with the national dish of the Philippines! Adobo is a simple but hearty Filipino dish, featuring chicken marinated in vinegar and soy sauce, then slowly cooked with garlic and spices. Serve over steamed white rice.",
      "Step 3: Ginataang Manok is a Filipino chicken dish flavored with ginger and coconut milk. \"Each family has their own version,\" says daplo. This is my mother's version.

      "Step 4: Chicken legs and shiitake mushrooms simmer in chicken broth with bean thread noodles in this comforting Filipino noodle soup. \"Super tasty!\" raves JessicaRabbit0722. \"This was comfort food to me...similar to my Mom's. The older I get the more I want to learn Filipino recipes for my daughter to eat. A little time consuming but worth it. I will have to try it with cabbage and carrots next time. I like my veggies. Also my mom adds ginger to her recipe.\"",
      "Step 5: \"Typically cooked on the stove top, this yummy comfort food is straight from the Philippines, but cooked in the slow cooker for ease!\" says Jennifer Lee Kirk. \"Serve over rice.\"",
      "Step 6: This thick Filipino porridge features chicken wings and rice in a broth seasoned with onions, ginger, and garlic. \"This is the BEST Arroz Caldo recipe!\" says Lindsay Ceballos. \"It has become a staple in our house. I use regular white rice and whatever chicken I have on hand and it always comes out perfectly. It's quick easy and my kids practically eat the whole pot.\"",
      "Step 7: This savory Filipino stew is made with a whole chicken, tomatoes, and potatoes. \"This is a dish we make back in the Philippines,\" says candysweetemo. \"It's really delicious, and you can substitute pork for chicken or mix them both. Great over rice!\"",

And there's plenty to choose from. The Philippines are comprised of thousands of small islands -- so the idea of regional cooking doesn't even begin to explain the situation. Just about every cook has her own signature recipe for adobo, pancit, and other specialties. These are just some of our favorite Filipino recipes with pork as a primary player.",
      "Step 2: Sauteed noodles combine with shrimp, pork, and bok choy, flavored with onion, garlic, ginger, oyster sauce, and red pepper flakes. \"Delicious and easy!\" says Rayna Jordan.",
      "Step 3: Here's a classic Filipino soup with pork chops. \"Amazing!\" raves sd_cutie. \"Loved how the soup was salty and tangy! I think this is even better than the sinigang I had at a restaurant! I added baby bok choy instead of green beans.\"",
      "Step 4: Crispy fried Filipino egg rolls are filled with seasoned ground pork, onion, carrots, and celery. Make and freeze a big batch so they're always on hand. Bd.weld rates it 5 stars: \"This is by far the best lumpia recipe I have tried here on AR.\"",

      "Step 7: \"Pork spareribs are glazed with the sweet, tangy taste of the Philippines,\" says CHRISTYJ. \"One of the ingredients, star anise, is native to China; it is a star-shaped, dark brown pod that contains a pea-sized seed in each of its eight segments.\"",
      "Step 8: With this hearty Filipino soup, mung beans are simmered in chicken broth with prawns and diced pork. Nancy30 rates it 5 stars: \"Om my gosh --excellent! I've never cooked mung beans before, always just sprouted them. I had no idea how delicious they are -- they look like lentils when cooked but taste like black eye peas. May be one of my new favorite soups!\"",
      "Step 9: Chopped pork loin and shrimp are stir-fried and combined with lots of veggies: garlic, onions, tomatoes, zucchini, okra, green beans, eggplant, and bitter melon. \"I loved this dish!\" raves Ann Marie Natal. \"The blend of vegetables and cooking method used here resulted in a hearty dish. Very lovely flavors.\"",
      "Step 10: Elegant enough for special occasions, this Filipino stew features pork, liver, potatoes, garlic, and bell peppers cooked in a rich tomato base.",

      "Step 12: These Filipino empanadas are filled with ground pork, onions, peas, carrots, potato, and raisins. \"This pork filling can be made way ahead of time to shorten the preparation time for these Filipino empanadas,\" says lola. \"Use my recipe for empanada dough.\"",
