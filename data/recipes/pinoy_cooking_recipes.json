Leave to cool for a moment then pick up the ball of syrup. If it's pliable, sticky and can be moulded in your fingers easily, it has reached the soft ball stage.       ​​​​​",

            "Evenly coat the spheres from bottom to the sides paying attention to the edges.  If coating on the edges are too thin, they will crack when you release it from the mold.  You can do a first coat, freeze, then coat a thin layer again. Either way, it works.",
            "If your chocolate bomb was molded too thick, the steaming hot milk will have a hard time melting it in a mug. You'll miss the fun part. The chocolate bomb will still melt because of the hot milk but you have force it with a spoon. You don't want that.",
            "When melting the 2nd half's edges or rim over the hot pan, do not re-use the part with melted chocolate already. If you do this, it will ruin your 2nd sphere and will have to repeat the process. Use the clean area of the pan.",
            "If you will decorate with white chocolate like how I did, melt the chocolate like how you melted the chocolate for the sphere. Transfer to a piping bag then cut the tip to make a very small hole. Immediately decorate with sprinkles. You don't want the white chocolate to dry up and the sprinkles won't stick.",
            "Consume the chocolate bombs within 24 hours for best results or store a room temperature for up to 5 days.",
